## How Contributions Work

We use GitHub for version control, issues, and pull requests. To contribute:

1. Create a new branch from `main`
2. Commit your changes with clear messages
3. Push to your fork and open a pull request
4. Describe what your PR does and reference any related issues

---

## Testing

We use **Jest** for testing. Please:

- Write unit tests for new features or logic
- Use `__tests__` folders or `.test.ts` files
- Run tests with:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- Ensure your code passes tests before submitting a PR

## Code Style & Best Practices

### TypeScript

- Use strict mode (enabled in `tsconfig.json`)
- Add types for all variables, parameters, and return values
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes

### Code Quality

- Lint with **ESLint**
- Format with **Prettier**
- Add meaningful JSDoc where appropriate
- Use clear variable/function names
- Write small, modular functions
- Favor `async/await` over `.then()`
- Handle errors using `try/catch`
- Store config in environment variables

Before submitting a PR:

1. Make sure tests pass
2. Follow the code style guidelines
3. Update documentation if needed
